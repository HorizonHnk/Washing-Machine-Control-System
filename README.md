# Washing Machine Control System

## Overview
> A comprehensive Arduino-based automation system for controlling and monitoring washing machine operations.

## Features
- Automated cycle management for different washing programs
- Water level and temperature monitoring
- Motor speed control for various cycle types
- LCD user interface for program selection and status
- Error detection and notification system

## Components
- Arduino Mega/UNO controller
- Water level sensors
- Temperature sensors
- Motor driver circuit
- Solenoid valves for water control
- LCD display and control buttons
- Power management system

## Implementation
> This project demonstrates practical application of embedded systems design for home appliance automation.

```cpp
// Sample code snippet for motor control
void controlMotor(int speed, int direction) {
  digitalWrite(DIR_PIN, direction);
  analogWrite(PWM_PIN, speed);
}
```

## Future Improvements
